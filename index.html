  Right side: Billy! <br>

Left side: Mandy! <br>

Right side: Billy! <br>

Left side: Mandy!<br>

(The song starts)<br>

Billy: Please vote me the Keeper of the Reaper.<br>

I wanna be the Keeper of the Reaper!<br>

His skinny white bones are mine to own,<br>

To do with as I see fit!<br>

Give him to me and I promise my love won't quit!<br>

Mandy: I disagree about the Keeper of the Reaper.<br>

It should be me who's the Keeper of the Reaper.<br>

Grim's not a toy for an idiot boy,<br>

Who can't even tie his shoes! <br>

If Billy wins, then we all surely lose!<br>

Grim: Don't I get a say in the Keeper of the Reaper?<br>

I'll make you all pay for the Keeper of the Reaper!<br>

All my rage is bound up in this cage held back by these iron bars!<br>

I'll never get rid of these mental scars!<br>

Judge Roy Spleen: I don't care who's the Keeper of the Reaper!<br>

I'm losing my hair over Keeper of the Reaper!<br>

A mountain of stress is crushing my chest!<br>

I'm going blind in one eye<br>

and it's all because of that stupid guy! (points at Fred Fredburger)<br>

Fred Fredburger: (while eating some nachos) Don't worry, I found some nachos! Yes!<br>

(Judge takes nachos away, and hits Fred on the head with his gavel)<br>

Billy (rapping): Time to break it down, old school style!<br>

Billy: Grim is the corner in my square!<br>

Mandy: Grim's the chocolate in my eclair.<br>

Billy: Grim is the freshener in my air!<br>

Mandy: Grim's the conditioner in my hair.<br>

Billy: Grim's the picnic in my bear!<br>

Mandy: Grim is the cushion on my chair.<br>

Billy: (with a French accent) Grim is the renaissance in my fair!<br>

Mandy: Grim is the anger in my stare.<br>

Billy: Grim is the stain in my underwear!<br>

Mandy: Somehow I knew you were gonna go there.<br>

All: We all need a Keeper of the Reaper!<br>

I wanna see the Keeper of the Reaper!<br>

Fred Fredburger (over others): I just want some nachos.<br>

Grim: All this singing is driving me nuts!<br>

All: Why not just cut Grim in half?<br>

Fred Fredburger (over others): How I miss my nachos.<br>

Judge: My ulcer's eating away at my guts!<br>

All: That would be a real, good laugh!<br>

Mandy: I totally hate<br>

That we have to debate<br>

Billy: That whether it's me or you!<br>

All: It's obvious to everyone here,<br>

It's obvious to everyone here,<br>

It's obvious to everyone that.<br>

Fred Fredburger: I have to go poo poo!<br>

(Everyone stops singing)
