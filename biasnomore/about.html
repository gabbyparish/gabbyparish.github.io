          <h3>WHY DOES THIS SITE EXIST?</h3>
        <p>
          Bias No More aims to educate you on the effect that racial bias has on Black Americans when it comes to criminal investication.
        </p>
        <p>
          For as long as 38 years, innocent Black lives are spent in prison for crimes they did not commit. This is most often than not due to insufficient DNA research and lack of investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spending even as short a time as 3 years in prison while being innocent can have life-long effects and no amount of cempensation can take back those years.

        <h3>HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS SITE</h3>
        <p>
          This site features an archive of cases surrounding Black Americans who have been failed by the American justice system and have been falsely convicted for crimes they did not commit. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This is when our biases can be extremely damaging and dangerous when being brought into a crime context. Oneâ€™s bias cannot be the main contributor when finding a suspect of a crime. DNA cannot be ignored the way it has been in countless cases. It is the DNA that should be the first evidence that is investigated and researched thoroughly. 
        </p>
 
        <p>
          When bias becomes the priority of an investigation, the true perpetrators who are not under this bias are roaming free and may continue to offend. Often white perpetrators have the privilege to be overlooked as a suspect and if they are caught, it often takes longer than black perpetrators. 
        </p>
   
        <p>
          This platform aims to share the stories of many Black Americans who have been wrongfully convicted and to educate viewers of how this can so negatively impact their lives. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In doing so, we hope to bring more attention to this issue and for this to be brought into action through sharing this site, as well as making donations seen throughout the platform and sharing those too.

        <h3>WHY IS THERE RACIAL BIAS IN SOCIETY?</h3>
        <p>
          The way we are raised can very much impact the way we see the world and other people. Those we have been surrounded by growing up are those we become most familiar and comfortable with. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This is often translated to how we view race either through our own lives or through the media. If someone grows up in a predominantly white community, they will be most familiar with the white experience and lifestyle. If they are not surrounded by not so many people of colour, they may only have the media as their resource of what people of colour are like as people. 
        </p>
 
        <p>
          The media takes in the conventions and stereotypes of different kinds of people and puts that in the forefront. Unfortunately, with so much of the media being owned by white corporations run by white people, there is often a lack of differing perspectives when it comes to the content we consume.  
        </p>
   
        <p>
          This lack of different perspectives can be most impactful to viewers is when it comes to the news. Whether we are reading a newspaper, watching a news program or reading news articles online, it is the headline that catches out attention. Just a sentence can shape which opinions we form of the article before we start reading or watching it.

        </p>

        <p>
          It is when these headlines make assumptions about race based on bias and stereotypes where they can become dangerous. When words such as THUG, GANGS, TERRORIST, ANIMALS and others exist, they are so often linked to the people of colour in question. These words have been used when no conclusions have even been made in whether they are guilty or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, white suspects in question are more often described as TROUBLED, FAMILY MAN, STUDENT or MENTALLY ILL. This implies that they are innocent on default, yet what they have done is just a minor flaw in their character.
