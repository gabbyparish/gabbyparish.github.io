    <h3>HIGHLIGHTED CASE</h3>
    <h4>THE EXONERATED (CENTRAL PARK) FIVE 1989-2002</h4>

    <p><span>WHO:</span></p>
    <p> Antron McCray (15), Kevin Richardson (14), Raymond Santana (14), Korey Wise (16), and Yusef Salaam (15)
    </p>
<br>
    <p><span>THE CASE:</span></p>
    <p> These five teenagers from New York were accused of the beating and rape of Trisha Meili, who was jogging in Central park. Four of the teenagers were originally taken in for investigation as suspects, as they were seen in the park that night, yet in a different section to the crime. The fifth boy, Korey Wise was invited by police to give his friend Yusef Salaam company while he was being questioned. Some time later, Korey was questioned and added to the suspect list.
    </p>
<br>
    <p><span>THE SENTENCES:</span></p>
    <p> Yusef Salaam was sentenced to serve five to fifteen years of Juvenile Prison for first-degree rape and robbery.
    </p>

    <p> Kevin Richardson was sentenced to serve five to ten years of Juvenile Prison for attempted murder, first-degree rape, first-degree robbery and also first-degree sodomy.
    </p>

    <p> Antron Mccray was sentenced to serve five to ten years for first-degree rape and robbery in Juvenile Prison.
    </p>

    <p> Raymond Santana was sentenced to serve five to fifteen years of Juvenile Prison for first-degree rape and robbery.
    </p>

    <p> Lastly, as Korey Wise was 16 when convicted, he was sentenced to five to fifteen years as an adult in Prison for first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree assault and first-degree degree riot.
    </p>
<br>
    <p><span>TIME SERVED:</span></p>
    <p>Yusef Salaam: 6 years and 8 months (Juvenile)</p>

    <p>Kevin Richardson: 5 1/2 years (Juvenile)</p>

    <p>Antron Mccray: 6 years (Juvenile)</p>

    <p>Raymond Santana: 5 years (Juvenile)</p>

    <p>Korey Wise: 12 years (Adult)</p>
<br>
    <p><span>WERE THEY GUILTY?:</span></p>
    <p>No, there was no sufficient DNA evidence to match to any of the teenagers.</p>
<br>
    <p><span>HOW WERE THEY CONVICTED?:</span></p>
    <p>Detectives were asked to collect and question any black male who was in Central Park that night of the incident. Investigators were struggling to come to a conclusion of who was responsible for the beating and rape, so they narrowed their suspects down to these five boys.</p>

    <p>They were brought into individual questioning without being sure they are with a parent or guardian or even their right to a lawyer. This is illegal, and these young boys were not told by detectives that they have those rights.</p>

    <p>While being questions, all five of the boys denied being involved in the incident and said multiple times they were not eve aware that that incident even happened. In return, detectives became more verbally and physically abusive and forced each of the boys to say they were a witness and that one of the other five boys was attacking the woman. </p>

    <p>This abuse and coercion went for hours without the access to sleep or food overnight into the next day. Eventually, when detectives had all of the boys saying what they wanted to hear, they filmed these coerced confessions on camera. These videos were used as evidence against the five boys. Despite the investigator’s failure to find any actual DNA evidence, their manipulation of the court system lead them to win the case.</p>
<br>
    <p><span>WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE?:</span></p>
    <p>The five convicted may not have been freed from their sentences if it wasn’t for the actual perpetrator, Matias Reyes who decided to come clean and confessed to the beating and rape of Trisha Meili. Despite this, Matias was first considered to be the sixth culprit of the crime, but this was later debunked.</p>
<br>
    <p><span>WHICH REPARATIONS WERE RECEIVED? </span></p>
    <p>Now men, Yusef Salaam, Kevin Richardson, Antron Mccray, Raymond Santana and Korey wise were given $40 million in reparations between the five of them when they were exonerated in 2002. This was received after the city of Manhattan was sued for wrongful incarceration and conviction.</p>

    <p>While the $40 million is a sizeable amount for the five to be granted, this cannot reverse all the emotional trauma and those formidable adult years each of the men could have spent in freedom.
